# 5G SCG: Cardiovascular Activity Monitoring Using mmWaves

Welcome to the 5G SCG project! This repository focuses on using mmWaves, a high-frequency band from 5G networks, to monitor cardiovascular activity. By leveraging RF-sensing technology, this project demonstrates the potential of a non-contact system to capture cardiovascular signals resembling Seismocardiograms (SCG).

# ðŸ“™ Project Overview
The project explores the use of radio waves to detect chest vibrations caused by heart movements. An RF signal is transmitted toward the chest, and its reflection is analyzed to measure distance changes caused by cardiac activity. This process captures SCG signals, which provide detailed information about the heart's functioning, including fiducial points that map to cardiac events like valve openings and closings.

## Highlights
1. **System Design**: Includes mmWave hardware components and software for real-time data processing.
2. **Applications**: Cardiovascular monitoring and disease detection.
3. **Future Potential**: Integration with everyday devices like smartphones and home routers for affordable healthcare solutions.
